The repository is a part of [this](https://github.com/users/Aman9026/projects/3) project and contains the solutions of all the problems I attempted in practice or competitions on [Codezen](https://codezen.codingninjas.com/dashboard) which would be definetly very helpful if you've started competitive programming. 

***You are always welcome to add more or optimize any solution in this repository by following [these](https://github.com/Aman9026/Codezen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) instructions.***
