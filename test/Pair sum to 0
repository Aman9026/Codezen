Given a random integer array A of size N. Find and print the pair of elements in the array which sum to 0.
Array A can contain duplicate elements.
While printing a pair, print the smaller element first.
That is, if a valid pair is (6, -6) print "-6 6". There is no constraint that out of 5 pairs which have to be printed in 1st line. You can print pairs in any order, just be careful about the order of elements in a pair.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer N (Array size)
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)
Output format :
Line 1 : Pair 1 elements (separated by space)
Line 2 : Pair 2 elements (separated by space)
Line 3 : and so on
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6
Ai contains all non-zero values
Sample Input:
5
2 1 -2 2 3
Sample Output :
-2 2
-2 2
