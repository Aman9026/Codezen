Input Format:
First line will have an integer ‘t’ denoting the number of test cases.
Next ‘t’ lines will have an integer ‘val’ each.
Output format:
Print ‘t’ lines of output denoting the sum of all the digits of the number in each test case.
Constraints:
1 <= t <= 10^5
0 <= val <= 10^18
Sample Input:
2
1547
45876
Sample Output:
