/*
PROBLEM:
You are given two integers N and i. You need to make ith bit of binary representation of N to 0 and return the updated N.
Counting of bits start from 0 from right to left.
Input Format :
Two integers N and i (separated by space)
Output Format :
Updated N
Sample Input 1 :
7 2
Sample Output 1 :
3
Sample Input 2 :
12 1
Sample Output 2 :
12


CODE:
*/

    /* Don't write main().
     * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     * Return output and don't print it.
     * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
